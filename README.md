# 📊 Iris Dataset Analysis

This project contains a Python-based analysis of the classic **Iris dataset**, using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. It includes data loading, basic exploration, visualization, and findings based on the dataset.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Load and explore the Iris dataset
- Perform basic data analysis with **pandas**
- Create visualizations using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**
- Identify patterns and insights from the data
- Handle potential errors gracefully with exception handling

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn.datasets` (for loading Iris)

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Pair plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Box plots by species

---

## 🧠 Observations

- Petal measurements are key in distinguishing between Iris species.
- Clear separation between species can be observed in pair plots.
- Dataset is well-balanced and clean, requiring minimal preprocessing.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The notebook includes error handling for:

- File not found errors
- Missing or malformed data
- Invalid data types
